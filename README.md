A brief play around with the bored API and Halfmoon css library

I created this project specically to have a play with the Halfmoon css library and a couple of api enpoints.

for more information select
- Halfmoon css library -  https://github.com/halfmoonui/halfmoon
- Board Api - https://www.boredapi.com/documentation
- Pixabay -  https://pixabay.com/api/docs/

To get the random images you will need a pixabay API key, rename keys.js.example to keys.js and update the API key.
